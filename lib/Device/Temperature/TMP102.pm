=head1 NAME

Device::Temperature::TMP102 - I2C interface to TMP102 temperature sensor using Device::SMBus

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Device::Temperature::TMP102;

  my $device = shift @ARGV || '/dev/i2c-1';

  my $dev = Device::Temperature::TMP102->new( I2CBusDevicePath => $device );

  my $temp = $dev->getTemp();

  print "Temp:\n";
  printf ( "\t%2.2f C\n", $temp );
  printf ( "\t%2.2f F\n", $temp * 1.8 + 32 );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Read temperature for a TMP102 temperature sensor over I2C.

This library correctly handles temperatures below freezing (0 degrees Celsius).

=head1 TROUBLESHOOTING

Check for your device on i2cbus 1 using the i2cdetect command, e.g.:

  $ i2cdetect -y 1

       0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
  00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
  10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
  20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
  30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
  40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 48 -- -- -- -- -- -- --
  50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
  60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
  70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

This indicates my TMP102 chip address is 0x48 on i2cbus 1.

Use the command-line tool i2cget to try to get a 12-bit reading from
the device, e.g.:

  $ i2cget -y 1 0x48 0x00 w
  0x2003

Refer to the documentation on L<Device::SMBus> for information on
enabling the i2c driver.

I also found this page to be helpful:

  http://donalmorrissey.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/raspberry-pi-i2c-tutorial.html

In the process of testing this on raspberry pi, I saw this error:

  perl: symbol lookup error: .../Device/SMBus/SMBus.so: undefined symbol: i2c_smbus_write_byte

The fix was to install the package libi2c-dev.

    Example code for the TMP102 11-bit I2C temperature sensor

    You will need to connect the ADR0 pin to one of four places. This
    code assumes ADR0 is tied to VCC.  This results in an I2C address
    of 0x93 for read, and 0x92 for write.

    This code assumes regular 12 bit readings. If you want the
    extended mode for higher temperatures, the code will have to be
    modified slightly.

=head1 VERSION

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 I2CDeviceAddress

Contains the I2CDevice Address for the bus on which your TMP102 is
connected. The default value is 0x48.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 getTemp()

    $self->getTemp()

Returns the current temperature, in degrees Celsius.

=head2 convertTemp()

    $self->convertTemp( $reading )

Given a value read from the TMP102, convert the value to degrees
Celsius.
